# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
Object-Oriented Programming is based on four fundamental pillars:
## 1. Abstraction
Abstraction hides the internal implementation details and shows only the essential features of an object.  
## 2. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to take many forms. It enables method overloading (compile-time) and method overriding (runtime). 
## 3. Encapsulation
Encapsulation bundles the data (variables) and the code (methods) acting on the data into a single unit (class) and restricts access using access modifiers (like `private`, `public`).  
## 4. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass), promoting code reusability.
